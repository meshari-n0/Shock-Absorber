# Shock Absorber – CAD Assembly (Onshape)

A fully modeled and assembled **shock absorber** designed in **Onshape**, built from technical drawings and assembled with proper mates to simulate realistic motion.

---

## Project Overview

This project presents a complete CAD assembly of a shock absorber, focusing on:

 **Mechanical design accuracy**
 **Clean assembly structure**
 **Correct mate setup & motion behavior**
 **Realistic compression/extension (suspension-like)**

---

## Components Included

The assembly contains the following parts:

- **Base**
- **Top Rod**
- **Spring**
- **Nut / Adjustment Gear**

Each part was modeled individually and then assembled using Onshape mates.

---

## Assembly & Motion

Mates used to achieve realistic behavior:

- **Cylindrical Mate** → rotational alignment  
- **Slider Mate** → vertical compression & extension  
- **Screw Mate** → threaded movement simulation  
- **Fastened + Planar Mates** → fixed constraints & stability  

This enables the shock absorber to behave similarly to a real suspension system.

---

## Design Goals

- Apply correct **mechanical constraints**
- Practice **multi-part CAD assembly**
- Simulate **linear spring motion**
- Improve skills in **Onshape Assembly & Mate Connectors**

---

## Tools Used

- **Onshape (Cloud-based CAD)**
- **Mate Connectors**
- **Assembly Mates**
- **Parametric Part Design**
